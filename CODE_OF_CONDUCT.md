# Code of Conduct

## What is this code of conduct for?

Code of conduct is a current set of rules for contributing and communicating.

## Examples of appropriate behavior

* Using welcoming and inclusive language.
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
* Focusing on what is best for the community.
* Showing empathy towards other community members.

## Examples of inappropriate behavior

Because we come from a variety of backgrounds,
we do not want to assume that everyone has the same assumptions
about what is and is not appropriate.
Here are some examples of inappropriate behavior
that are incompatible with our community's ethos:

* spamming, trolling, intentionally disrupting conversations,
  or irrelevant solicitation or advertisement;
* making demeaning or discriminatory comments;
* making negative assumptions about someone's background,
  abilities, or intentions;
* harassing or stalking individuals (online or in person).

In general: treat others how you would like to be treated,
were you in their place.
Do ask questions.
Do keep conflicts productively focused on technical issues.
Do remember that we are all people, not robots,
and all equally deserving of sensitivity and respect.

## What will organizers do about inappropriate behavior?

If we notice you doing or saying something inappropriate,
an organizer will ask you to stop.
We will not demonize you.
But please do stop the inappropriate behavior
so we can get back to writing and discussing code in a safe environment.
If you have philosophical disagreements about what is actually inappropriate,
please take them to a separate public or private conversation
with a maintainer
so we don't turn pull requests into an ethics debate.
If you keep doing unacceptable things,
we will likely ban you, report you to the administration,
or take other appropriate action.

## What if I see or am subject to what feels like inappropriate behavior?

Let us know.
Please notify a community organizer as soon as possible.
Full contact information is listed in the Contact Info section of this document.
All communications will be kept strictly confidential,
unless otherwise required by law.
No issue will be considered too inconsequential or unimportant for us
to have a conversation about.
